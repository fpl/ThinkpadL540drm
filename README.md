# Thinkpad L540 DRM Linux kernel issue fix

This is a kernel patch for a Thinpad L540 specific DRM issue.

This is a simple patch for a lousy issue of Thinkpad L540 due to wrong LCD information that causes color banding onto the panel.
It can be applied to any kernel starting from 4.0 and up to 6.1.

-- Enjoy
